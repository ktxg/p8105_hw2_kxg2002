## Load in the trash wheel data

``` r
trash_wheel_data = 
  read_excel(
    path = "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-homes_powered) %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

## Read and clean 2017 and 2018 precip data

``` r
precip_data_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    path = "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",  
    sheet = 6, 
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = "2017") 
  
  
precip_data_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    path = "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = 5, 
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>%  
  mutate(year = "2018") 
```

## Combine precip data sets

``` r
precip_data = 
  full_join(precip_data_2017, precip_data_2018) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "total", "year")

## Write about the data

Looking at the two datasets from 2017 and 2018, we can see that there
was a substantial amount of precipitation for both years in May and
July. However, there were also differences. For example, in 2018 there
was a large amount of precipitation in September compared to 2017, where
there was not a lot of precipitation. There were 12 observations in the
2017 precipiation data, 12 observations in the 2018 precipitation data,
and 344 observations from the trash wheel data. Key variables in the
precipitation data included month, total, year. Key variables in the
trash wheel data included dumpster, month, year, date, weight\_tons,
volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette\_butts,
glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags, sports\_balls. The total
precipitation in 2018 was 70.33, and the median number of sports balls
found in dumpsters in 2017 were 8.

## Load, read, and clean data in pols-month.csv

``` r

  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), month = as.integer(month), day = as.integer(day)) %>%  
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  select(year, month, day, prez_gop, prez_dem, everything()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    prez_gop:prez_dem,
    names_to = "president", 
    values_to = "status"
    ) %>% 
  select(year, month, president, everything(), -day, -status) 
```

## Load, read, and clean data in snp.csv

``` r

  read.csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(col = date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), month = as.integer(month)) %>%  
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>%

## Load, read, and clean data in unemployment.csv

``` r

  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year)) %>%  
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemployment") %>%  
    janitor::clean_names()
```
